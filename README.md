# mxmmlANTLR
A first attempt at writing an MML parser using ANTLR for **[mxTune][1]**. For reference only. It suffers from some bad decisions regarding tied note processing. [mxTune][1] now uses [mxmml][2].

In the future I plan to integrate the tied note processing methodology from [mxmml][2] and update the MML grammar. This still has potential use as  tool to flag incorrectly written MML.
